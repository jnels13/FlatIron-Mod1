# FlatIron-Mod1  

At the early age of our startup, we're beginning to develop a linear-regression model using Seattle residential sales data. Middle-class homes tend to be more standardized, while luxury homes contain non-standard features not reflected in the dataset which can affect price (i.e., built-in electronics, artisan or high-end woodwork, tilework, and appliances/fixtures).  According, the model will focus on middle-class homes. 

In this repository, the Jupyter Notebook ("**index.ipynb**") contains the development of our early linear-regression model, including an explanation of which variables from the King County, WA dataset were included, dropped, and transformed (and why), and how the model was developed. 

The non-technical presentation is included both in video and PDF formats ("**presentation.pdf**"), explaining our approach and our early results. The video presentation may be viewed here: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1fh8rhT9pYPnBuxGetf4pyuTUNKLRabY7
