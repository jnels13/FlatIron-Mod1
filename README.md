# Applying Linear Regression to Determine the Most Important Features in Home Pricing
## King County, Washington

For this project, I was tasked with applying linear regression models to the King County, WA, real-estate dataset.  I took the approach of a startup real-estate company developing a model to predict home prices and looking at the most important features in determining price.

Our company, Move On Up, is set to disrupt the real estate industry in Seattle by giving homebuyers and sellers an alternative to the 4-6% fees typically charged by traditional real estate agents, using a predictive model for home pricing, and connecting buyers and sellers through an on-line portal. 

At the early age of our startup, we're beginning to develop a linear-regression model using Seattle residential sales data from the King County, Washington, real-estate data set. Middle-class homes tend to be more standardized, while luxury homes contain non-standard features not reflected in the dataset which can affect price (i.e., built-in electronics, artisan or high-end woodwork, tilework, and appliances/fixtures).  According, the model focuses on middle-class homes. 

In this repository, the Jupyter Notebook ("**index.ipynb**") contains the development of our early linear-regression model, including an explanation of which variables from the King County, WA dataset were included, dropped, and transformed (and why), and how the model was developed. 

The non-technical presentation is included both in video and PDF formats ("**presentation.pdf**"), explaining our approach and our early results. The video presentation may be viewed here: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1fh8rhT9pYPnBuxGetf4pyuTUNKLRabY
